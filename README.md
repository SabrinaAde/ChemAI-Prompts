# ChemAI-Prompts
Chemistry Prompt Curation to help train ChatGPT, Claude, Bing AI and more to give accurate and precise answers to chemistry questions


This project is meant to be open access for all and for educational purposes only. This project will focus primarily on helping to train AI models with carefully curated chemistry prompts to help improve its performance on finding research papers within chemistry initially. Chemistry is incredibly vast but one of the main way to learn and understand the landscape of chemistry is being able to find, summerize and understand scientific papers. 

The prompts should:<br>

-Improve AI models to become highly specific and effecient at finding peer reviewed papers in chemistry <br>

-Train AI to use relatively small prompts to get to the correct answer <br>

-Train AI to provide correct answer from users with little knowledge or experience in the field in question <br>

-Prompts should not have to be complete sentences or use proper grammer to obtain correct answer from AI <br>

-Prompts will aim to be 40 words or less <br>

# Key: <br>
"  "prompt given to an AI model,for these examples will be using Chat-gpt3 unless stated otherwise <br> [  ]- AI's answer<br>

# Mechanistic Studies <br>

Goal of prompt: Have AI correctly give me reaction classification, proposed mechanism and an example of a paper correlating to said reaction/mechanism. <br>
There is a lot of chemistry so the initial types will be broken up to the following: oxidation, reduction, substitution, addition and elimination (photo redox, electrochem etc. covered later). This initial step based on probing chatgpt with "for questions about chemical reactions and their mechanism give top three types of chemical reactions students ask you about. I assume they are doing so for midterms exam in organic chemistry". However, oxidation and reduction were not answeres; got included as those are important transformtion.
